Python static site generator for my blog

This is a custom site generator that uses Mako templating and Markdown to convert a directory tree of blog or portfolio entries into a static site. It's a little clunky and needs refactoring, so I can't recommend anyone actually use it, but it works for me!

A TODO here is to make a tiny example site so you can see how things work.
